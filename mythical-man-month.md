#### Joys of the Craft
* The sheer joy of making things.
* The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people.
* Watching complex objects of moving parts work together in subtle cycles.
* The joy of always learnings which springs from the non-repeating nature of the task.
* The delight of working in such a tractable medium. Creating by exertion of imagination. Few media of creation lend themselves to flexibility and so readily capable of realizing conceptual structures.

> Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.
